# Zine Viewer - Hackathon Edition

A visually stunning, desktop-focused interactive zine viewer designed to win hackathons. This project showcases advanced UI/UX techniques, immersive animations, and modern design aesthetics using React 18, Tailwind CSS 3, and Framer Motion.

## üèÜ Hackathon-Ready Features

### Visual Excellence

- **Dynamic 3D Background**: Immersive network visualization using Three.js and Vanta.js with optimized performance
- **Comet Cursor**: Custom fiery comet cursor with dynamic particle effects and interactive feedback
- **Magazine-Style Layout**: Premium editorial design with dynamic grid layouts and visual hierarchy
- **Glassmorphism Effects**: Modern glass-like UI components with backdrop blur and subtle transparency

### Interactive Elements

- **Animated Gallery**: Stunning image gallery with hover effects and detailed modal views
- **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle animations that respond to user actions for enhanced engagement
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: Elements that animate into view as users scroll through content
- **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth scrolling with keyboard navigation support

### Technical Highlights

- **Performance Optimized**: Code-splitting with React.lazy for faster initial load times
- **Responsive Animations**: Frame-rate optimized animations that maintain smooth performance
- **Modern Color Scheme**: Vibrant gradients with red accents and a cohesive color palette
- **Advanced Particle Systems**: Dynamic particle effects for visual interest and engagement

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

This project has been carefully optimized for maximum performance during the hackathon presentation:

- **Code Splitting**: Components are lazy-loaded using React.lazy to reduce initial bundle size
- **Reduced Particle Count**: Optimized particle effects in the custom cursor for smooth performance
- **Throttled Event Handlers**: Mouse events use throttling to prevent performance bottlenecks
- **Memoized Components**: Key components use React.memo and useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized Vanta.js Settings**: 3D background effects use optimized settings (reduced points, increased spacing)
- **Efficient Asset Loading**: Images are properly sized and optimized for quick loading
- **Reduced Animation Complexity**: Animations are designed to be visually impressive while maintaining performance
- **Frame Rate Capping**: Background animations are capped at 30fps to save resources

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
